Rules for new and improved games

## Games
### Uno
Improved rules for Uno which are objectively superior
### Unopoly
A version of Monopoly played using UNO cards as dice and other events. Far superior to original Monopoly, in that it is even more random and chaotic, thus redirecting all potential hatred of other players onto the game itself.
