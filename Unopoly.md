# Unopoly

Version 2.1

A version of Monopoly played using UNO cards as dice and other events. Far superior to original Monopoly, in that it is even more random and chaotic, thus redirecting all potential hatred of other players onto the game itself.

## Requirements
* Monopoly game of your choice
* Uno deck of your choice

## Rules
### Rent groups
* There are four coloured rent groups:
 * Blue: blue and brown properties
 * Green: green and light blue properties
 * Yellow: yellow and pink properties
 * Red: red and orange properties

### Uno property
* When there is one property left which has not been bought, the right to buy it goes to the first player who shouts "UNO!" when anyone lands on that property

### Movement
* Instead of rolling dice, a player draws an Uno card
* If the drawn card is a number, move that many spaces
* If the drawn card is 0, remain on the current square and take its action again
* If the drawn card is the same number as the previous card, double the movement
* If the drawn card is the same number as the previous two cards, go to jail

### Special cards
These are the non-number cards which have special effects
#### Instant use
These cards have an instant effect on the game
##### +2
* Draw two further cards, and choose one of them to play with, proceeding as normal
* If both drawn cards are special cards, go to jail
* If both cards are the same value, treat them as a double
    * If the card before the +2 is also of the same value, go to jail

##### Blank
* Starting with the player who drew the blank card, and proceeding in the usual order, players instantly move to the corresponding square across the diagonal line from Go to Free Parking (i.e. a player who is on Old Kent Road would move to Mayfair, and a player who is on Leicester Square would move to Northumberland Avenue) and must take the corresponding action.

##### Reverse
* The direction in which players move around the board is reversed. Any Chance or Community Chest cards which cause movement to a particular Square should follow this new direction of movement.

#### Keep and use later
These cards can be kept for use at a different time. Each player may only hold up to 3 at any one time; they may discard any unwanted cards to meet this limit.
##### Skip (ðŸš«)
* This card may be used to avoid paying rent on any property of the rent group corresponding to its colour
* This card may be combined with a Wild card to avoid paying rent on any property

##### Wild
* This card may be used to get out of jail free
* This card may be combined with a Skip card to avoid paying rent on any property

##### +4
* This card may be used to avoid paying rent on any property
* Each player may only hold one of these cards at any time, regardless of how many other special cards they hold
