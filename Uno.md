# Uno

Version 1.0

Improved rules for Uno which are objectively superior

## Standard rules
All usual Uno rules apply, except:

### +2/+4 Chaining
* +2 cards can be deferred to the next player by playing another +2 or a +4 on top of them
* +4 cards can be deferred by another +4, or a +2 whose colour matches the new colour chosen by the +4
* Blank/Suicide cards can be used to defer +2 or +4 cards without adding to the pick up total
* Chaining continues until a player cannot defer the pickup, at which point they must pick up the combined total of all +2 and +4 cards in the chain

### Uno pickup
* Rather than picking up 2 cards in the event of being caught not saying Uno, pick up 5

### Colour changing
* When a Wild or +4 card is played, the new colour is decided by the first player to name a valid colour, regardless of who played the card. The card must be touching the discard pile before the colour is named.

### Blank/suicide
* Blank cards (if the deck has them) are treated as "suicide" cards, and every player must pick up one card, including whoever played it

## Optional rules

These are further rules which may optionally be implemented
### Two player reverse
* When only two players are remaining, reverse cards cause players to swap their current hands
